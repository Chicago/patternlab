title: City Colors
---

The city colors derive from the official City Seal and City Municipal Flag. They cannot be altered and are an essential part of the city's identity. In usage, however, it should be noted that the flag blue does not provide sufficient color cotrast with text (WCAG 2.0 AA standards).
